**Abstract**: Banners are present in several forms and a person might be inspired by one or more of these. However, designing banners is a non-trivial task, especially for novices. Starting from a blank canvas can often be overwhelming, and exploring alternatives is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to transfer a novice user's content into an example banner. Our algorithm begins with extracting the template of the example banner via a semantic segmentation approach. This is followed by an energy-based optimization framework to combine multiple design elements and arrive at an optimal layout. A crowd-sourced experiment comparing our automatic results against banners designed by creative professionals indicates the viability of the proposed work.
