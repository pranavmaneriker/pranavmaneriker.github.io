![Me][Photo]{: .circle-image}

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. My advisor is [Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/).

My areas of interest lie in the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning. 
I am also interested in the fairness and explainability of machine learning models.

I graduated with a B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in English Literature from IIT Kanpur.

Previously (2016-2018), I was a Research Scientist at the Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Research, Bangalore. Most of my work there involved natural language processing and statistical modelling. 

I have also spent grad school summers doing internships - as a applied scientist intern at the Buyer Fraud team at Amazon in Seattle, WA, and as a research intern under [Jay Stokes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jstokes/) at Microsoft Research (remotely), at Dataminr under [Octavian Udrea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/octavian-udrea-954aa7200) (remotely), and at [SCALE 2022](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/research/scale/scale-2022/) program at JHU in Baltimore, MD.

The details of my publications are available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9t8gbkkAAAAJ&hl=en), and some selected publications are also in my resume. 

You can find most of my undergraduate projects on the projects page.
