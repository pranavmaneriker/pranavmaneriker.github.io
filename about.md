![Me][Photo]{: .circle-image}

I am currently working as Member of Technical Staff at Bid Data Experience Lab, Adobe Research, Bangalore. Most of my work is in natural language processing and statistical modelling. 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur. I also completed all requirements for a minor in English Literature.

The areas that interest me are distributional semantics, the usage of style in text and text generation. 

Apart from that, I enjoy squash, speedcubing, chess, snooker, reading (mostly fiction) and running. 

The details of my publications are available in my resume. Most of my undergraduate projects can be found on the projects page.
