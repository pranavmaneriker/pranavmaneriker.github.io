![Me][Photo]{: .circle-image}

I am currently a PhD student at The Ohio State University at Columbus, Ohio. My advisor is [Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/).

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Research, Bangalore. Most of my work there involved natural language processing and statistical modelling. 

I graduated with a B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in English Literature from IIT Kanpur.

The details of my publications are available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9t8gbkkAAAAJ&hl=en) and some selected publications are also in my resume. 

Most of my undergraduate projects can be found on the projects page.
