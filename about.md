I am a Senior Researcher at Dolby Laboratories in Atlanta, GA. 
My research focuses on the application of foundation models to visual and multimodal understanding, with a particular emphasis on structured representations.

I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from The Ohio State University. Under the guidance of [Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/), my doctoral research investigated the role of structures, particularly graphs, in building adaptive machine learning applications.
 My [thesis](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/etd/r/1501/10?clear=10&p10_accession_num=osu1713459591984102) also included work on uncertainty-based auditing for machine learning models.

Prior to my graduate studies, I served as a Research Scientist at the Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Research, in Bangalore from 2016 to 2018, with a focus on natural language processing and statistical modeling. 
I hold a B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in English Literature from IIT Kanpur.

My experience also includes applied science and research internships at diverse organizations, including Amazon (Buyer Fraud team in Seattle, WA), Microsoft Research (under [Jay Stokes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jstokes/), remotely), Dataminr (under [Octavian Udrea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/octavian-udrea-954aa7200), remotely), and as a Visiting Research Scholar at the [SCALE 2022 program](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/research/scale/scale-2022/) at JHU in Baltimore, MD.

My research interests lie at the intersection of multimodal models, diffusion models, graphs, and uncertainty quantification.

Outside my research, I enjoy relaxing with good coffee alongside my partner and our cat, Sage. I also find time for reading and running, often combining the two with audiobooks.

Details of my publications are available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9t8gbkkAAAAJ&hl=en). You can find most of my undergraduate projects on the [projects page](/projects).
