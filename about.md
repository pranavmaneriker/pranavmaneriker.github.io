![Me][Photo]{: .circle-image}

I am an undergraduate (just finished!) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. 

I have completed all requirements to graduate with a minor in Literature, so I'm hoping to.

My interests include parallelisation, functional programming, cryptology, security and machine learning.

Apart from that, I enjoy squash, speedcubing, chess, snooker and reading (mostly fiction). 

Most of my projects can be found on the projects page, which is (not) updated regularly.
