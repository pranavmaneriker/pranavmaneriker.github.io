![Me][Photo]{: .circle-image}

I am a fourth year undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. 

I should (hopefully) graduate with a minor in Literature.

My interests include algorithms, graphics, parallelisation and machine learning.

Apart from that, I enjoy squash, speedcubing, chess, snooker and reading (mostly fiction). 

Most of my projects can be found on the projects page, which is (not) updated regularly.
