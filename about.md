![Me][Photo]{: .circle-image}

I am a fourth year undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur. 

My interests include algorithms, graphics, parallelisation and machine learning.

Apart from that, I enjoy squash, speedcubing, snooker and reading (mostly fiction). 

Some of my projects can be found at the github link given in the footer.
