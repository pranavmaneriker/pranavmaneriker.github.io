The tl;dr version:

Always walk facing traffic.


### Choice

As a pedestrain, I feel that there is often a confusion amongst my fellow pedestrains about which side of the road that they should walk on. The issue essentially boils down to: whether you should face the incoming traffic or follow the direction of the traffic. My argument is that one must face the incoming traffic.

The simple reason being: both you and the driver can see each other , and in case a correction needs to be made in order so as to avoid a collision, both can take appropriate action.

So if you are confused, go against the flow, you will avoid accidents.
