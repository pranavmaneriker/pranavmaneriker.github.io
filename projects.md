##Computer Science and Engineering

###**SAT solving on GPUs**
_CS498: Undergraduate Project, Fall '15_

WIP

***

###[**SVM approximation methods**](../assets/cs678-report.pdf)

_CS 678: Learning with Kernels, Fall '15_

A (theoretical) study and comparison of DC-Pred++ and LDKL. The report includes the history and origin of the algorithms as well as how they compare in performance.

The presentation for the project can be found [here](../assets/cs678-pres.pdf)


***

###[**Mozart/Oz**](https://gitlab.com/pranavmane/CS350)

_CS 350: Principles of Programming Languages, Fall '15_

Some problems whose solutions are implemented in Oz. Also includes an interpreter for the declarative semantic model of Oz (including threads).

Oz has a well-specified declarative semantic model.

###[**Reinforcement Learning in Haskell**](https://github.com/arnabgho/RLearnHaskell)

_CS 653: Functional Programming, Fall '15_

A library for reinforcement learning in Haskell. Implementation of SARSA, QLearn and an example game (cat and mouse).

The goal was to add the algorithms into HLearn, but a lot of work remains before that can be done.

[This poster](../assets/poster-cs653.pdf) accompanied the final presentation for this project.

Note: The content is based on the notes and programs given [here](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/RL1/).

###**Scene Classification**

_CS 679: Machine Learning for Computer Vision, Winter '14_

Implementation of the paper - Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Natural Scene Classification (Fei-Fei Li, Pietro Perona).

The paper uses a bag-of-words model to classify natural scenes into various categories. 

Done in Matlab. 

***

###[**Java Compiler**](https://gitlab.com/sara_polyn/cs335-course-project)

_CS 335: Compilers, Winter '14_

Compiler for a subset of Java to MIPS written in C++

Supports looping expressions, type checking, primitive datatypes, 1D arrays and recursion

***

###[**Pogo-Flip**](https://github.com/pranavmaneriker/pogo-flip)
_CS 360: Introduction to Computer Graphics, Fall '14_

A game using the core OpenGL API

Implementes basic physics, texture loading, a navigable (3d) camera and blinn-phong shading.

***

###[**Template Creator**](https://github.com/pranavmaneriker/template-creator)

_CS252: Computing Laboratory, Fall '14_

Ruby on Rails project. Create homepages, resumes and templates with MathJax support.

A [report](https://github.com/pranavmaneriker/template-creator/blob/master/finalreport.pdf) is also available in the repository.

***

###[**NachOS**](https://gitlab.com/pranavmane/nachosassignment2.git)
_CS330: Operating Systems, Fall '14_

Linked here is the second assignment of three assignments that included implementations of:

- System calls pertaining to Fork, Exec, Join, Yield, Sleep and Exit
- UNIX, First in First Out, Round Robin, Shortest Job First and Non-Preemptive job scheduling algorithms
- Random, First in First Out, Least Recently Used (LRU) and LRU Clock page replacement algorithms
- Semaphores

***

###[**Rubik's Pocket Solver**](https://github.com/pranavmaneriker/RubiksPocketSolver)

A solver for the 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube. A Breadth First Search based approach.

***

###[**Gest-reco**](https://github.com/pranavmaneriker/gest-recof)

_Programming Club, IIT Kanpur, Summer '13_

Gesture recognition using OpenCV. A (slightly over-the-top) demo video is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-55tBvrD2g)

Colour filtering followed by a classifier trained with SVM. 

***

###**PseudoGit**

_ESc 101: Fundamentals of Computing, Fall '12_

Java, MySQL based implementation of basic version control features. Features implemented include separate local/remote stores with diffs, pull from remote, merge etc. Branching not supported.

***

##Other

###[**Fewest Moves**](https://prezi.com/cng_isud-im-/rubiks-cube-fewest-moves/)

A (somewhat) popular prezi about Rubik's Cube's Fewest Moves solving.

The original purpose was for a lecture I took at the Rubik's Cube Hobby Group, IIT Kanpur.
